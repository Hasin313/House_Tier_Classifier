# House_Tier_Classifier
🏠 House Quality Classifier: Tier Prediction Using Images &amp; Tabular Data This project aims to classify residential properties into three quality tiers — Tier A, Tier B, and Tier C — based on both structured tabular data (like square footage, age, etc.) and visual features extracted from house images (walls, floors, stains, cracks, etc.).
